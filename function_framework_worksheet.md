# Function Design Worksheet

This worksheet is meant to give you an idea of how to break apart a task into a modular function. You will be working to identify the elements of input, logic, output, and naming.

## Essential vocabulary

* Modular: a function is meant to be reused and repeated. Making something modular means that it can be slotted in and reused however.
* Parameters: what values should be fed into the function to be processed? These are the input for the function.
* Return: this is the output value from the function, what is given back to to the program after the function finishes execution.
* Calling: this is when the program asks the function to execute.

### Before you write a function

Before you can start writing code for a question, you should be able to answer a few quesitons about it:

1. What should the name of the function be? This is the name that will be typed into the program when the function is called, so it should be meaningful.
2. What are the parameters that should be provided to the program as input (if any)? You should have a clear idea of what the input data types should be, what they should be called, and what the semanatic content of that value should contain. 
3. What are the actions that the function should take inside?
4. What should be returned? What value or object should be passed back to the program to use. 

## Example solution:

### Find the first letter

* Prompt:  Write a function that returns the first letter of a word.

1. Name: getFirstLetter
2. Input: a single word, stored as a string. Likely named word_in
3. Actions: slice out the first letter of the string coming in, maybe some cleaning with `.strip()` to take out whitespace.
4. Return: the single resulting character, which will be be a string data type


## Problems
